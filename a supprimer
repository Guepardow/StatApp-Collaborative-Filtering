Those people tend to vote Democratic. The figures of the November 2012 election confirm this trend: 71% of Hispanics and 93% of African Americans gave their vote to Obama.

South of the country is not spared, and it is even there that Hispanic populations are growing the most quickly since 2000. The region is increasingly multicultural, and the vote of minorities tends to shake its past logic.

Some analysts are wondering if the Deep South couldn’t one day become Democrat.


Trapped in demographic dynamics that are unfavorable to the very heart of their historic HQ, Republicans have therefore preferred to temporarily stifle the problem rather than treat it at the source.

Rather than adapt their ideological line to the changing American electorate, and strive to become attractive to "Non-Whites", they preferred to silence their voices in addressing human rights. 

In other words they have instrumentalized the Supreme Court to clear their growing electoral weakness. 

Section 5 has been sacrificed in a vain attempt, just as many Texans right to vote  because they do not have the opportunity to bow to the constraints of the voting ID. 
By relying only on a “white vote” which significance is plummeting, the Republican Party is in my opinion shooting itself in the foot .

This would not necessarily be a bad thing if It doesn’t bring down with it 50 years of struggle for civil rights.
